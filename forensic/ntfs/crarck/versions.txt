   - Intel GPU not supported until they fix the OpenCL driver.

1.1c
  - AESNI bug on stored files fixed

1.1b
  - NVIDIA Maxwell support.
  - Intel GPU support temporarily removed due to a lot of errors
in Intel OpenCL driver.

1.1a
  - WinXP support fixed. But future WinXP support is not
guaranteed.

1.1
  - Haswell AVX2 support, 2 times faster, CPU rate up to 4.50!
  - Linking CUDA 5.5 surprisingly resulted in 30%-50% speed-up
on Fermi and Kepler cards
